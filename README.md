# Customer_Classification_Predictions

This project focuses on classifying customers into distinct categories based on demographic and behavioral data using machine learning techniques. It helps businesses better understand their customer base and make strategic decisions to improve engagement and sales.

## 📌 Objective

To build and evaluate multiple machine learning models that can accurately classify customers based on input features.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** – Visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning models and evaluation

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset is loaded from a CSV file and includes customer-related attributes such as:

- Age
- Income
- Spending Score
- Gender
- And possibly others

*(Note: Please check the `.ipynb` notebook for actual feature details.)*

## 🚀 Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Importing data using `pandas`
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical data
- Splitting into training and testing sets

### 2. Data Visualization
- Correlation heatmap
- Distribution plots
- Boxplots and pairplots to explore relationships

### 3. Model Building
The following classification models are trained and tested:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

### 4. Model Evaluation
Models are evaluated using:
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

### 5. Results
The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics and can be used for real-world customer classification tasks.

## 📊 Output

The project demonstrates:
- Clear data visualization
- Multiple model performances
- Model comparison for accuracy and effectiveness

## 📈 Applications

- E-commerce customer segmentation
- Telecom customer retention
- Banking and finance risk profiling
